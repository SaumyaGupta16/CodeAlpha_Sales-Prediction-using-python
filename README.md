# Sales Prediction Using Advertising Data

This project forecasts product sales based on ad spending across TV, Radio, and Newspaper platforms using multiple regression models.

## Dataset
- Columns: TV, Radio, Newspaper, Sales
- Cleaned and preprocessed (removed unused columns)

## Methods
- Models used: Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso
- Evaluation: R² Score and RMSE
- Visuals: Correlation heatmap, Actual vs Predicted, Residual plots

## Results
All models showed high accuracy with R² ≈ 0.91. Residuals were low and well-distributed, confirming a good fit.

## Conclusion
Linear regression performed well. Ridge and Lasso provided stable alternatives to reduce overfitting and maintain generalization.
